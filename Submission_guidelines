1. Make a folder with your name. 
2. Nomenclature has to be mandatorily followed for making folders. I'll be removing all files without proper nomenclature during weekly cleanups. 
3. Nomenclature for folder: Task<task_number>_<month_3_inital_letters>_<first_name_3_initals>_<last_name_3_intials> 
4. Nomenclature for file: Task<task_number>_<month_3_inital_letters>_<first_name_3_initals>_<last_name_3_intials>_2
