# Arduino Obstacle Avoidance System
                                    
This project demonstrates an obstacle avoidance system using Arduino and an ultrasonic distance sensor, designed and simulated in Tinkercad.

## Project Overview

The robot uses an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to continuously measure the distance to obstacles in front of it. 

## Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
- LED (with resistor)
- Breadboard and connecting wires

## Simulation on Tinkercad
