Task 1: UART Communication

Theoretical Background UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) is a serial communication protocol that does not rely on a shared clock signal between the transmitter and the receiver. Instead, it uses start and stop bits to frame data packets and requires both devices to be configured to the same baud rate, such as 9600 bps, to ensure data is sampled correctly. In this simulation, the Arduino Uno acts as the transmitter, converting the analog voltage from a potentiometer into digital data which is then sent bit-by-bit to the PC via the serial TX line.

Observations During the simulation, it was observed that rotating the potentiometer directly influenced the numerical output displayed on the Tinkercad Serial Monitor. The values fluctuated smoothly between 0 and 1023, reflecting the 10-bit resolution of the Arduino’s analog-to-digital converter. The data appeared in real-time without the need for additional synchronization wires, confirming the efficiency of asynchronous communication for simple sensor monitoring.

Task 2: I²C Communication (Master-Slave)

Theoretical Background I²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a synchronous, multi-master, multi-slave protocol that uses only two wires: SDA (Serial Data) for data transfer and SCL (Serial Clock) for synchronization. Unlike UART, I²C uses an addressing system where the Master initiates communication by sending the unique address of a specific Slave device. This protocol is highly efficient for connecting multiple integrated circuits over short distances using a shared bus, as seen with the A4 and A5 pins on the Arduino Uno.

Observations In the simulation, the Master Arduino successfully requested data from the Slave Arduino. It was observed that the Slave only transmitted the potentiometer's value when the Master sent a request to its specific address. This demonstrated the master-controlled nature of the I²C bus, where data flow is strictly regulated by the clock signal and addressing logic, ensuring no data collisions occurred between the two boards.

Task 3: SPI Communication (Basic Data Transfer)

Theoretical Background SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a high-speed, synchronous serial communication protocol that utilizes four dedicated wires: MOSI (Master Out Slave In), MISO (Master In Slave Out), SCK (Serial Clock), and SS (Slave Select). It is a full-duplex protocol, meaning data can be sent and received simultaneously. The Master provides the clock signal on the SCK line to synchronize the data bits moving across the MOSI and MISO lines, while the SS line is used to activate the specific Slave device for communication.
